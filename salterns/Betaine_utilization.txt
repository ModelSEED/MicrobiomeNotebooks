  - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0026261724606791 - Microbiology (2024)
  - Note: Direct evidence for betaine metabolism in Synergistales is limited; evidence is by phylogenetic inference from related amino acid-fermenting anaerobes

  ---
  5. Clostridia (Tissierellales - Dethiosulfatibacteraceae) (2 bins)

  Bins: concoct_out.9 (R1_A_D1), concoct_out.85 (R1_C_D2)

  Metabolic pathway: Uncertain - potentially Stickland-type fermentation
  - Dethiosulfatibacteraceae are anaerobic amino acid fermenters
  - May possess glycine/betaine reductase systems based on phylogenetic position
  - Limited direct experimental evidence for betaine metabolism in this family

  Note: I did not find peer-reviewed literature specifically documenting betaine metabolism in Dethiosulfatibacteraceae. Their inclusion in the betaine-associated set may be based on genomic predictions (presence of betaine reductase genes) rather than biochemical validation.

  Summary Table

  | Taxon                    | # Bins | Metabolic Use of Betaine                    | Evidence Level         |
  |--------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|
  | Halanaerobium            | 6      | Electron acceptor → TMA + Acetate           | Strong                 |
  | BM714 (Clostridia)       | 4      | Stickland electron acceptor → TMA + Acetate | Moderate (genus-level) |
  | Acidaminobacteraceae     | 1      | Stickland electron acceptor                 | Moderate               |
  | Synergistales            | 2      | Possible electron acceptor                  | Limited                |
  | Dethiosulfatibacteraceae | 2      | Unknown/predicted                           | Weak                   |

● Key Conclusion

  The dominant metabolic fate of betaine among these taxa is reductive cleavage producing trimethylamine (TMA) and acetate. This occurs via:

  1. Stickland fermentation - Betaine acts as electron acceptor coupled with amino acid oxidation
  2. Direct H₂-dependent reduction - Betaine reduced to TMA + acetate using hydrogen as electron donor

  The Halanaerobium and Clostridia (BM714/Acidaminobacteraceae) groups have the strongest experimental evidence. The Synergistales and Dethiosulfatibacteraceae bins may interact with betaine based on genomic predictions, but direct experimental evidence is limited for these specific taxa.



Based on the metabolic pathways documented in the literature, none of these organisms are likely to use betaine as a sole carbon source for growth. Here's why:

  Metabolic Distinction

  The organisms in your betaine set use betaine as an electron acceptor, not as a carbon source:

  | Taxon                    | Role of Betaine                   | Carbon Source                       |
  |--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | Halanaerobium            | Electron acceptor → TMA + Acetate | Carbohydrates or amino acids        |
  | BM714 (Clostridia)       | Electron acceptor in Stickland    | Amino acids (alanine, valine, etc.) |
  | Acidaminobacteraceae     | Electron acceptor in Stickland    | Amino acids                         |
  | Synergistales            | Likely electron acceptor          | Amino acids                         |
  | Dethiosulfatibacteraceae | Likely electron acceptor          | Amino acids                         |

  Key Evidence

  Stickland fermentation couples:
  - Oxidation of an amino acid (carbon/energy source)
  - Reduction of betaine (electron acceptor → excreted as TMA + acetate)

  From the literature:
  - Clostridium sporogenes "was unable to catabolize betaine as a single substrate" - it requires an amino acid electron donor (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC242311/)
  - Haloanaerobacter salinarius "grows by fermenting carbohydrates or by using the Stickland reaction with serine or H₂ as electron donors and glycine-betaine as acceptor"

  Organisms That CAN Use Betaine as Carbon Source

  For comparison, organisms that truly use betaine as a carbon source employ a different pathway - sequential demethylation:

  Betaine → Dimethylglycine → Sarcosine → Glycine → Serine/Pyruvate

  Examples include:
  - Acetobacterium woodii (acetogens)
  - Some aerobic methylotrophs
  - Certain sulfate-reducers (Desulfuromonas)

  These taxa are NOT represented in your betaine MAG set.

  Conclusion

  The 15 MAGs in your betaine set are predicted to respire betaine anaerobically (using it as a terminal electron acceptor) while deriving carbon from amino acids or carbohydrates. They produce TMA and acetate as waste products, which may then feed into methanogenesis or other community processes.

  Summary for Your MAGs

  The organisms in your betaine set (Halanaerobium, Clostridia) would primarily use:

  rxn17220: Betaine reductase (EC 1.21.4.4)
    cpd00540 + cpd28060 + cpd00009 + 2 cpd00067 →
